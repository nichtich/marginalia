NAME
    Marginalia - extract annotations from PDF files

DESCRIPTION
    This is just an experiment with PDF file format, iText, and maven

USAGE
    You need maven2 to compile and run this application. Then try:

    $ mvn assembly:assembly

    If you are lucky, maven will install all required dependencies, compile,
    and create a single jar that includes all dependencies. You can run it:

    $ java -jar target/marginalia-0.0.1dev-jar-with-dependencies.jar file.pdf

    Or try:

    $ mvn compile
    $ mvn exec:java
